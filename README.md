## Project Description
In this project, I explore various factors that could influence the outcome of a football match. The analysis aims to:
* Improve domain knowledge of football and football betting.
* Develop machine learning models to predict match outcomes and the number of goals scored.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This project requires Python 3.8+ and the following Python libraries installed:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy
* Scikit-Learn
* Imbalanced-Learn
* Statsmodels

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the prerequisites via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data
The project uses the "Ultimate 25k+ Matches Football Database" dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/ultimate-25k-matches-football-database-european].
It contains information on 11 European football leagues for 2008-2016 with matches, players, teams, as well as team and player attributes from FIFA games.

## Analysis
The analysis is contained in a Jupyter Notebook analysis.ipynb and includes:
* Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Statistical Inference
* Prediction Models

## Conclusions and Potential Improvements
The final section of the notebook discusses the results of the analysis, as well as potential areas for further improvements.
